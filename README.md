# Neopixel
Startup collateral for neopixel projects based on pico microcontroller

I've done a bunch of projects which all have a set of basic requirements
* Control a strip of neopixels
* Connect to wifi

Instead of copying the latest one, try to base the next one on something repeatable and able to be maintained centrally. Example = The wifi connection is flakey in a bunch of my projects - would be nice to fix it in one place and have the rest "just work."
